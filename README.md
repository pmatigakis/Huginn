Huginn is a flight simulator designed for software-in-the-loop and
hardware-in-the-loop simulations.

This is in very early stage of development. See the documentation for
instructions on how to build and use Huginn.

The web interface of Huginn is using the jQuery Flight Indicators by Sébastien Matton.
